            for this to work, the myrtille services need to run on the same machine as the myrtille gateway
            the myrtille gateway can't recycle its own application pool because it doesn't have enough privileges
            the recycling action creates a new w3wp.exe process, running under the pool identity
            the old (recycled) w3wp.exe process remains alive as long as there is an ongoing http request to the application (graceful exit)
            when it's over, the old process is stopped, all its allocated resources are returned to the operating system and the new process takes over
